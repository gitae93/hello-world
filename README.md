# hello-world
Greeting. Here is my first repository.

Hi Neighbors!

I'm Student of Hanseo University(but, last semaster) and major aerospace software engineering. I learned C/C++ Programing and most computer science subjects including Data Structure, System Programming, Algorithms, Operating System and etc..
I am even learning RTOS, Avionics, control engineering.

So I prefer to C/C++ Programming to develop any embedded system as well as drone.

This repository is a space to continue consistent coding study and to upgrade program level increasingly.

Always welcome to your visit and greeting any opinions, comments.
Thank you.
